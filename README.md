# NYCRP Discord Bot

This is a Discord bot our company developed for a client who runs a private server in the Roblox game **[Emergency Response: Liberty County (ER:LC)](https://www.roblox.com/games/2534724415/Emergency-Response-Liberty-County)**.  

The bot integrates with ER:LC's API to provide server management tools for staff and a better experience for players.
